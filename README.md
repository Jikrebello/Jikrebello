ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m James and this is my github.

ðŸŽ“ Got my Bachelor of Computer and Information Sciences in Game Design and Development from the IIE at Vega School Johannesburg.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in anything C# related, in particular game development using Unity or the MonoGame framework but am also currently getting stuck in with C++ and learning Azure and (AWS) Amazon Web Services.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently expanding my C# and C++ repertoire, with my focus on learning new design patterns.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can contact me on my email at jikrebello.za@gmail.com
