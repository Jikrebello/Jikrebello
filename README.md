👋 Hi, I’m James and this is my Github.

🎓 Got my Bachelor of Computer and Information Sciences in Game Design and Development from the IIE Vega School Johannesburg.

🌱 Outside of Web development I’m interested in game development with the Stride game engine and am currently developing a 3D action platformer, as well as a multi-platform ERP.
