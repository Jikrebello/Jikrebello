👋 Hi, I’m James and this is my Github.

🎓 Got my Bachelor of Computer and Information Sciences in Game Design and Development from the IIE Vega School Johannesburg.

👷‍♂️ Currently I'm a Junior Full Stack ASP.NET MVC developer at Devloop.

🌱 Outside of web development, I’m interested in C#, C++ and GDscript for use in game development using Unity, Unreal Engine and the Godot Engine, and the SFML and RayLib frameworks.

📫 How to reach me: You can contact me on my email at jikrebello.za@gmail.com
