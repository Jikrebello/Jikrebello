ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m James and this is my github.

ðŸŽ“ Got my Bachelor of Computer and Information Sciences in Game Design and Development from the IIE at Vega School Johannesburg.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in anything C# related, in particular game development using Unity or the MonoGame framework but honestly I'm happy to learn about anything Code related, even if its out of my comfort zone.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently still expanding my C# repertoire and enjoy learning about new design patterns and anything Object Orientated, as well as T-SQL.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can contact my on my email at jikrebello.za@gmail.com
